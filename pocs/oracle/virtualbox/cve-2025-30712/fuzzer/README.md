# Fuzzer Harness for the DevVGA device

This harness is meant to be an incomplete and illustrative PoC, not a working
fuzzer.

The changes that would make this fuzzer a working PoC are included in the file
`fuzzer_patch.diff`, however that patch is provided as a best-effort and there
might be different problems to solve with newer versions of VirtualBox.
