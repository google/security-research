# Vulneribility
 In function `check_mem_size_reg`, if the register of the argument of a helper function is not fixed, writes are not checked. Through this bug, an ebpf program can write to a map with flag BPF_F_RDONLY_PROG.


## Requirements to trigger the vulnerability
 - Kernel configuration: `CONFIG_BPF`
 - Are user namespaces needed?: No
