### Privilege escalation by patching kernel code to introduce a backdoor

In cases where code execution is established, but there is no process context to escalate privileges (like interrupt handlers) the simple way is to overwrite kernel code installing a backdoor in one of the syscalls and that backdoor can be later called from any process to gain root privileges. 
This is also useful when recovery is impossible and the kernel will hang/oops after installing the backdoor, rendering the process attempting exploitation useless. With this technique root shell can be executed from a completely separate process.
