## Determining the state of the buddy allocator by parsing /proc/buddyinfo

Linux kernel exposes statistics about each memory zone in a world-readable /proc/buddyinfo.
For example:
```
Node 0, zone      DMA      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      1 
Node 0, zone    DMA32      4      2      1      1      3      2      3      2 
Node 0, zone   Normal      0      1      0      2      2      2      2      3 
```

This means there are 4 order 0 pages, 3 order 1 pages, etc.

This is very useful when exploit needs to manipulate the buddy allocator to be able to get the target page even if it is not an exact match for the currently requested page (e.g. different order)
