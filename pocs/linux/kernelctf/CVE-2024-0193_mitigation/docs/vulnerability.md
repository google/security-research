- Requirements:
	- Capabilities: CAP_NET_ADMIN
	- Kernel configuration: CONFIG_NETFILTER, CONFIG_NF_TABLES
	- User namespaces required: Yes
- Introduced by: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=5f68718b34a5 (netfilter: nf_tables: GC transaction API to avoid race with control plane)
- Fixed by: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7315dc1e122c85ffdfc8defffbb8f8b616c2eb1a (netfilter: nf_tables: skip set commit for deleted/destroyed sets)
- Affected Version: v6.5-rc6 - v6.7-rc8
- Affected Component: net/netfilter
- Cause: Use-After-Free
- Syscall to disable: disallow unprivileged username space
- URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2024-0193
- Description: A use-after-free flaw was found in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. If the catchall element is garbage-collected when the pipapo set is removed, the element can be deactivated twice. This can cause a use-after-free issue on an NFT_CHAIN object or NFT_OBJECT object, allowing a local unprivileged user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to escalate their privileges on the system.
