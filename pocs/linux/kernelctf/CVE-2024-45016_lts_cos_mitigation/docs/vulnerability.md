A vulnerability in the traffic control subsystem's netem qdisc (`CONFIG_NET_SCH_NETEM ` in the kernel config) can lead to a use-after-free. The commit `5845f706388a ("net:netem: fix skb length BUG_ON in __skb_to_sgvec")` introduced the bug by making `netem_enqueue()` always return `NET_XMIT_SUCCESS` when a packet is duplicated, which can cause the parent qdisc's `q.qlen` to be mistakenly incremented. When this happens `qlen_notify()` may be skipped on the parent during destruction, leaving a dangling pointer for some classful qdiscs like DRR. There are two ways for this to happen:

- If the duplicated packet is dropped by `rootq->enqueue()` and then the original
  packet is also dropped.
- If `rootq->enqueue()` sends the duplicated packet to a different qdisc and the
  original packet is dropped.

In both cases `NET_XMIT_SUCCESS` is returned even though no packets are enqueued
at the netem qdisc. 

The bug was present in kernel versions `4.14-6.11` and was fixed by commit `c07ff8592d57 (netem: fix return value if duplicate enqueue fails)`. 

Commands for triggering the UaF:

```
ip link set lo up
tc qdisc add dev lo parent root handle 1: drr
tc filter add dev lo parent 1: basic classid 1:1
tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 drr
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: netem limit 0 dup 100
ping -c1 -W0.01 localhost # Trigger bug
tc class del dev lo classid 1:1
tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 drr
ping -c1 -W0.01 localhost # UaF
```
