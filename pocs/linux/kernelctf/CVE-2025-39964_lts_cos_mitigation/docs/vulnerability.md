- Description: A Out-of-bound access in the Linux kernel's crypto/af_alg. In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: crypto: af_alg - Disallow concurrent writes in af_alg_sendmsg Issuing two writes to the same af_alg socket is bogus as the data will be interleaved in an unpredictable fashion. Furthermore, concurrent writes may create inconsistencies in the internal socket state. Disallow this by adding a new ctx->write field that indiciates exclusive ownership for writing.
