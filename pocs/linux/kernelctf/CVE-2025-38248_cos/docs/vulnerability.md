# Vulnerability Details

- **Requirements**:
    - **Capabilities**: `CAP_NET_ADMIN`
    - **Kernel configuration**: `CONFIG_BRIDGE_IGMP_SNOOPING`
    - **User namespaces required**: Yes
- **Introduced by**:
    - https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=4b30ae9adb04 ("net: bridge: mcast: re-implement br_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions")
    - https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=2796d846d74a ("net: bridge: vlan: convert mcast router global option to per-vlan entry")
- **Fixed by**: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=f05a4f9e959e0fc098046044c650acf897ea52d2
- **Affected Versions**: `5.15 - 6.15.5`
- **Affected Component**: `net/bridge` (multicast snooping)
- **Cause**: Use-after-free
- **Description**: When per-VLAN multicast snooping is toggled, `br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit()` only cancels multicast router timers but does not remove the port from the global (or per-VLAN) multicast router port lists. A port in permanent multicast router state (`mcast_router=2`) can be re-added to the router list after snooping mode changes, and when the port is subsequently deleted, a dangling pointer remains in the list. Traversing the list (e.g., when adding a new port) triggers a use-after-free on the freed `net_bridge_port` object.

# Vulnerability Analysis

The bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast
router resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure
multicast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not
member in the matching MDB entry.

When per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast
context is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global
router port list:

```bash
# ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1
# ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy
# ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
$ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
router ports on br1: dummy1
# ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1
$ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
```

However, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN
multicast snooping is enabled:

```bash
# ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0
# ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
$ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
router ports on br1: dummy1
```

Since commit 4b30ae9adb04 ("net: bridge: mcast: re-implement
br_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions"), when per-VLAN multicast
snooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the
per-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a
result, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it
is deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is
traversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):

```bash
# ip link del dev dummy1
# ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy
# ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
```

Similarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port
list. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}
contexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the
per-VLAN router port list:

```bash
# ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1
# ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy
# bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1
# bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1
# bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2
$ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
      router ports: dummy1
# ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0
$ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
```

However, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when
per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:

```bash
# bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0
# bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2
$ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
      router ports: dummy1
```

When the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast
context will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled
on the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router
port list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead
to a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new
port to the list, for example):

```bash
# ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy
# bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2
# bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1
# bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2
```

The root cause is that `br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit()` only cancels
multicast router timers but does not remove the port from the router
port lists:

```c
void br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(struct net_bridge_mcast_port *pmctx)
{
#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6)
    del_timer_sync(&pmctx->ip6_mc_router_timer);
#endif
    del_timer_sync(&pmctx->ip4_mc_router_timer);
    // Missing: br_ip4_multicast_rport_del(pmctx)
    // Missing: br_ip6_multicast_rport_del(pmctx)
}
```

The fix adds the missing list removal calls so that ports are properly
unlinked from the router port lists during port/VLAN deletion.

Note that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only
takes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the
permanent one (2).
