- Affected Version: v5.8 - v6.9
- Affected Component: bpf
- Syscall to disable: bpf
- URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-41009
- Cause: Buffer overlapping
- Description: A buffer overlapping vulnerability in the Linux kernel's bpf ringbuf. It is possible to make a second allocated memory chunk overlapping with the firstchunk and as a result, the BPF program is able to edit the first chunk's header. Once first chunk's header is modified, then bpf_ringbuf_commit() refers to the wrong page and could cause a crash. We recommend upgrading past commit cfa1a2329a691ffd991fcf7248a57d752e712881
