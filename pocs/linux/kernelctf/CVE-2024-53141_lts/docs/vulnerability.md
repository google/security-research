- Affected Version: v2.7 - v6.12
- Affected Component: netfilter
- Syscall to disable: unshare
- URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-53141
- Cause: Out-of-bounds access
- Description: An out-of-bounds access vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter.
When tb[IPSET_ATTR_IP_TO] is not present but tb[IPSET_ATTR_CIDR] exists,
the values of ip and ip_to are slightly swapped, the range check for ip is missed and causes out-of-bounds access. We recommend upgrading past commit 35f56c554eb1b56b77b3cf197a6b00922d49033d
