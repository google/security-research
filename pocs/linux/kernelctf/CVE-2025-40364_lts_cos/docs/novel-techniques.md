# Turn limited UAF write into fully kernel read/write by exploit bpf_map_is_rdonly to abuse BPF verifier

Using cross-cache, we can reclaimed any struct into array_map pages, and just one UAF write, we can break verifier assume to build a stable kernel read/write primitive.

Some limitations

1. need unprivileged_bpf_disabled == 0
2. New the kernel version newer than c4c84f6fb2c4dc4c0f5fd927b3c3d3fd28b7030e, make normal user can use `map_freeze`
