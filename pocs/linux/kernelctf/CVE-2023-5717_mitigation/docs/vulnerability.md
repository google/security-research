`perf_read_group()` allocates a buffer based on an event's `read_size`, which depends on the size of its `sibling_list`.
If `perf_read_group()` is called when an event's `sibling_list` is smaller than its child's `sibling_list`, it may increment or write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.

This bug was introduced in commit fa8c269353d5 ("perf/core: Invert perf_read_group() loops") in kernel 3.16 and was later fixed in commit 32671e3799ca ("perf: Disallow mis-matched inherited group reads").
