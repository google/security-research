# v8CTF challenge

This challenge is part of the v8CTF, an exploit VRP for the v8 JavaScript engine.

See RULES.md for how to participate.

You can reach it at `nc v8.ctfcompetition.com 1337` or `nc $chalname.v8ctf.ctfcompetition.com 1337` for older versions, e.g. chrome-118.v8ctf.ctfcompetition.com.

It runs a `chrome --headless=new` on a user-provided URL. You can find the command line in chrome/challenge/chal and the Chrome version in chrome/challenge/Dockerfile.

The flag is at /flag/flag and is in the format `v8CTF{.*}`.
